"""Step 6b: route the LLM through the Portkey gateway.

Instead of calling Groq directly, the main LLM call goes through Portkey.
Portkey stores the real Groq credentials behind a "slug" (set up once in
the Portkey dashboard) - our code never sees the raw Groq key.

NOTE on fallback: we used to send a "config" (strategy: fallback + a
list of targets) via the x-portkey-config header, either as inline JSON
or as a saved config's "pc-..." slug. This Portkey workspace has
"block_inline_config" enabled, and there's no saved config to reference
either, so ANY x-portkey-config header - inline or slug - gets rejected
with `inline_config_blocked`. Routing straight to one provider via
x-portkey-provider sidesteps the config mechanism entirely (that header
isn't validated the same way), which is why this version doesn't send a
config at all. The tradeoff: no more automatic Portkey-side fallback to
a second slug if @hrpolicy fails - see docs/05_portkey_gateway.md.
